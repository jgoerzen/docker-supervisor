# Supervisor for Docker

This simple image installs supervisor, so you can plonk down your
processes in /etc/supervisor/conf.d.  It also installs a syslog
process that logs to stdout, effectively sending syslog to the Docker
logging system.

# Install

You can install with:

    docker pull jgoerzen/supervisor
